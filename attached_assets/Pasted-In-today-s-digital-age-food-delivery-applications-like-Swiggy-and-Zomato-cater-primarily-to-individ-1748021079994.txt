In todayâ€™s digital age, food delivery applications like Swiggy and Zomato cater primarily to individual or small group orders. However, there is a significant gap when it comes to bulk food ordering for events such as poojas, weddings, corporate meetings, or large family gatherings. This project aims to build a Catering Food Ordering Web Application specifically designed to allow users to place bulk meal orders (e.g., 100-500 plates) conveniently from verified catering vendors. Users can select the type of mealâ€”breakfast, lunch, or dinnerâ€”choose from a list of available caterers, view their menus, enter the number of plates required, and schedule the delivery date and location. The app provides the ability to view pricing per plate, estimated total cost, and supports order customization for vegetarian/non-vegetarian needs. A map integration helps users locate nearby caterers based on service availability. The caterers can register separately, list their available packages, set minimum and maximum plate limits, and manage incoming orders. The application supports order confirmation, status updates, and optional payment gateway integration. It simplifies the once time-consuming process of finding, contacting, and booking catering services. By digitizing catering orders, the app provides a seamless bridge between customers and catering vendors. This system also supports future scaling with user reviews, ratings, notifications, and real-time tracking. Overall, it offers a smart and scalable platform tailored for bulk meal needs.
