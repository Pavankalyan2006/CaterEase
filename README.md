🚀 Caterease – The Smart Way to Order Catering for Big Events

In a world full of food delivery apps, there’s still a huge gap when it comes to bulk food ordering for events. Whether it's a pooja at home, a wedding, or a corporate gathering, platforms like Swiggy and Zomato aren’t designed for booking food for 100+ guests.

💡 That’s why I created Caterease – a MERN-stack based catering food ordering application that connects users with trusted caterers for bulk meal orders.

🌟 Why Caterease?
✅ Order 50 to 500+ plates for breakfast, lunch, or dinner
✅ Browse menus and prices from verified local caterers
✅ Schedule future orders with delivery tracking
✅ Caterers get their own dashboard to manage menus and bookings
✅ Easy ordering, no phone calls or chaos
